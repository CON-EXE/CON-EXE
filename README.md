## About me

I’m currently attending the Software Developer program at MITT, where I’m building my skills and knowledge in the world of coding. While I'm still fairly new to the field, I put a lot of effort into my work and am passionate about what I do.

When I'm not working on anything I spend my free time gaming, playing with my dog, reading and when It's warmer out I take every oppertunity to get out on my mountain bike.

Feel free to check out my projects!
