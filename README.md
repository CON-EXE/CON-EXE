## About me

I'm a recent graduate of the Software Developer program at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology. I have hands-on experience with full-stack development and enjoy tackling new challenges head-on.

I’m an ambitious problem solver who always aims for the highest quality in my work — for me, having something “just work” isn’t enough. I strive to go above and beyond in every project I take on.

With my training and experience, I’m excited to start my career in the industry as a Junior Software Developer.

Feel free to reach out to me and check out my projects.
