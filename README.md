##About me
About me:
I’m currently attending the Software Dev 
eloper program at MITT, where I’m building my skills and knowledge in the world of coding. While I'm still fairly new to the field, I put a lot of effort into my work and am passionate about what I do.

I have experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm excited to continue learning and exploring new technologies as I grow in my caree.

I’m always eager to collaborate, learn, and take on new challenges. Feel free to check out my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you'd like to connect or collaborate!
